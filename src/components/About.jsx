                I am currently a 2B Computer Science Student at the University of Waterloo and am currently completing my second internship at Prodigy Game Education!<br /><br />

                I was previously a full-stack developer at the University of Waterloo, working on the Math Faculty Question Bank for professors and teaching assistants!<br /><br />

                Fun fact, I was previously a French journalist in the Greater Toronto area, and a Student Trustee for the Halton Catholic District School Board!<br /><br />
