            <Body>
                I am currently a 2B Computer Science Student at the University of Waterloo
                and am currently completing my second internship at <a href="https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/" style={{ textDecoration: "none", color: "black" }}><b>Prodigy Education!</b></a><br /><br />
                I'm currently interested in full-stack development, and have experience working with several web and mobile
                frameworks! Recently, I worked with React and React Native!<br /><br />
                I love to play piano in my free time, and I love to travel and drive to new places!
                Please feel free to reach me using my <a href="#contacts" style={{ textDecoration: "none", color: "black" }}><b>contacts</b></a> below!
            </Body>
